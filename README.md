# pleblist

Experimental song playback & queue system for streaming.
Intended usage:

* Window capture mode in OBS to play chat requested media (as fixed size window)
* Background music (windowless)
* Web (OBS browser)

Currently in *very* experimental state with a functional (but barebones) MPV
backend.
